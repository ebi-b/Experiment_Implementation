  <h1>Thanks for participating in Mental Workload Experiment</h1>

  <ul style=“list-style-type:square”>

    <li><h3>This Experiment must be done uninterrupted, then, before starting the experiment make sure, there won't be any distractions for the next 15-20 minutes. 
      We will record timestamps at each stage to ensure this.
    </h3></li>
    <li><h3>Since this is a very sensitive experiment, you must be fully attentive during the whole experiment. We have multiple attention checks during the study and if you miss them, we will withdraw your participation and end the experiment.
    </h3></li>
    
    <li> <h3>This experiment must be done on desktops or laptops and to complete it you need a mouse, keyboard, and a speaker or a headphone.
    </h3></li>
    
    <li> <h3> Then, before proceeding to the next step make sure you have all of these and you are in a place with no distractions.
